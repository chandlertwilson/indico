    "doug_1 = [\"Good morning. We're excited that you guys are here. Thanks for making the trip to come down. I hope you found the store visits yesterday productive. Today, we're going to share some information about why we're excited about our future, talk about our plan to win and give you some updates on the progress that we're making.First, I want to stop and thank the Walmart leadership team. We have a strong set of leaders. And not only are they driving change, they're just making a lot happen, period, around the world. And I want to thank them, I want to thank all of the associates that we have in Walmart for doing a great job. We're reconfirming our guidance next year because we see signs of the productivity loops starting to turn, giving us confidence that we'll deliver about 5 EPS growth next year. We're committed to cost reductions, and we think the timing is right to act on costs in a more aggressive way. We believe we can do so without harming the momentum we're driving on the top line. We have strong cash flow, and that financial strength gives us the flexibility we need to navigate this period of significant change. We believe we're striking the right and healthy balance between the short term and the long term. So the headlines for today are that we have a plan that plays to our unique strengths. It's resulting in momentum. We're acting faster as a company. And we're being disciplined about costs and capital as we go. No doubt we are in a transformational period of history. Business is transforming, and Walmart is transforming, too. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. Our future looks more digital. We use technology to serve customers more effectively and efficiently. We use technology to equip and empower our associates. To prepare for a larger transformation, we started by taking steps to strengthen our foundation. We committed that our investments in our people and in our stores would lead to a stronger positioning for the company, and we believe there's evidence of that happening. We're setting our associates up for success with better information, tools and training. We're improving the store experience. We're lowering prices. We're reducing excess inventory. We're improving our e-commerce offering, and growth has accelerated. We're setting priorities, including divesting some noncore assets. We're building on the stronger foundation with innovation, and you can see that we're doing it with more speed. We've been aggressive with Online Grocery expansion in the U.S., building on our international experience. We've been experimenting with delivery in the U.S. We created a digital payment platform in the form of Walmart Pay. And we're trying things like automated towers to speed the in-store pickup experience. We're digitizing the checkout experience with Scan & Go. We're making acquisitions to improve our online assortment. We're digitizing experiences in-store, including our pharmacy area. We're learning how to reward customers for behavior that helps us lower costs and save them money. Picking things up at store level for a discount is one example. We're expanding our delivery capabilities in China and other markets. We're enabling easy reorder online, and we're learning to partner with others in new ways. We've always enjoyed creating lasting win-win relationships, and that hasn't changed. The common thread in this innovation story is around the customer experience, especially convenience. We've made progress on value. Our prices are lower. On assortment, we have even more choice. And we're focused on saving customers' time and making it easier to shop with us. So let's go deep and talk about our strategy. The strongest strategies are built on unique strengths and assets, and we have many. \"]\n",
    "doug_2 = [\"But some of you may be asking, How relevant are they for the future? We think that depends on how customers will want to shop and be served in the future. So let's start with that.We think the future is a combination of digital and physical retail. Customers are shopping in-store, online, with apps and mobile, a little with their voice and in time, with AR and VR and whatever comes after that. And they'll do so seamlessly. There are times when it's easier to sit on the couch and order an item for delivery to your house. There are times when it's most helpful to order the weekly grocery trip on our app and pick it up after school without having to get the kids out of the minivan. And there are times when it's helpful to be in a store and be reminded of what we need or be pleasantly surprised by something we didn't expect. The same person will shop in different ways without thinking about channels. It's all just shopping at Walmart. What makes us think this is how people will shop? We shared our sweet spot with you a couple of years ago, and what we shared then is still true now. U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much, almost 2x, as customers that only shop with us in stores. And when customers that only shop in our stores become walmart.com customers, they spend more in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall. And for customers that shop in-store only and begin to use Online Grocery, they spend more with us in total after becoming an Online Grocery customer. It's a sweet spot for us, but it's also a sweet spot for our customers. Let's use the U.S. retail market as a way to explain it, but please note that a lot of what we're discussing is also true outside the U.S. The U.S. retail market, according to Forrester, is forecast to be around $3.5 trillion this year for the categories we sell, which would be 3.8 growth. Their estimates are that brick-and-mortar sales will make up $3.1 trillion, which will be a little more than 2 growth. And e-commerce at approximately $450 billion would grow 14. Let's click down another level. Look at how big grocery is in each case. Now this is Forrester's definition of grocery, and it doesn't include the consumables category, categories like paper goods that we normally group in our food and consumables numbers that we share with you in our releases. But the point is the same: Grocery is underdeveloped in e-commerce relative to stores. Why? Well, to grow a national e-commerce food business, it takes a few ingredients. You have to be able to keep perishable products fresh, available and at the right price. To do that, you need a perishable supply chain that supports stores that are near customers and great store associates to run them. To deliver value across a wide basket of goods, it's also helpful to sell a lot of general merchandise and apparel to help with the margin mix. It also helps to have a lot of scale because volume helps reduce markdowns and throwaways, which helps us sell at a lower price. Looking ahead, the combination of store volume, pickup volume and delivery is key. You need all 3 to achieve max scale.  Let me show you the same thing another way.\"]\n",
    "doug_3 = [\"As the new store number comes down, we've got a group of new stores that we built years ago that will be investing in remodels next year and over the next few years. That, combined with e-commerce growth and some investments in the supply chain, are where our priorities are, and we're trying to be very choiceful about that -- the investments that we make by geography and the other dimensions of our business. As it relates to building trust, we're all living in an increasingly transparent world. The things we think about here include global compliance and ethics, and we're all really proud of the progress we've made over the last few years with talent, process and systems as it relates to compliance and ethics. We have a stronger program, increased visibility and ability to detect, remediate issues as they come up. We're committed to that, and we're going to continue that good work. As it relates to social, environmental issues, we believe in shared value. We believe that all the stakeholders that Walmart touches can benefit as a result of the system that is Walmart. As it relates to communities, we want to make a difference on the ground. That really becomes tangible when we have things like hurricanes and earthquakes and, this week, fires. And you can see the humanity of Walmart stepping up and making a difference, but it happens every day, not just when there is a crisis. And we want to tell our story more effectively. We frequently wish that the world will look at the company as it is today. The good and and the bad. We're not perfect. But there are a lot of good things going on at Walmart, and Walmart does a lot of good things for the various stakeholders that we serve. So let's go a little bit deeper on sustainability, if we could.We set goals a little over 10 years ago, you may remember, to be supplied by renewable energy, to sell more sustainable products and sustainable packaging and to eliminate waste. And we've made some progress. We recently announced that we had achieved our 20 million metric greenhouse gas goal that we had set a few years ago. In fact, during that period of time, we eliminated 35 million metric tons of greenhouse gas out of our system. We had set a goal of sourcing $20 billion of goods from women-owned businesses. We recently announced that we had achieved that goal. So as things like that are happening, we've set some new ones.And as it relates to renewable energy, we want to get to 50 by 2025. We're at 26 now.As it relates to sustainable products, the Fortune cover that was on the previous slide was kind of highlighting the work that we've done on high-priority chemicals. But basically, the buyers are working in an item at a time to make things more sustainable. One of my favorites these days is this Pristine grape. And on the back of the package, it talks about how the supplier is using 100 drip irrigation systems on their farms and pack houses, and they're supplied by 80 renewable energy. All of their farms are certified for sustainable agricultural practices. And the grapes taste good. And they're good value at $2.28. So this relates to telling our story. It also relates to sustainability as the buyers are just making progress across the board. I think we can do a better job of communicating, and I think on pack is one good way to do that.As it relates to eliminating waste, we want to get to 4 of our larger countries and get to 0 waste by 2025. We're at 77 for the total company today. And as it relates to carbon, we recently set a goal that by 2030 with our suppliers, we would take out one gigaton of carbon from our system. So progress is continuing here.Let's go on to the next one.And as it relates to communities, there's a lot of good work going on. This commitment to source goods made in the U.S.A., we're on track to achieve the $250 billion number. We had set that goal in 2013. Just last week, Greg Foran was in South Carolina helping to open a tire factory that's going to create 1,700 jobs. That's fun to do. As it relates to veterans, we set a goal of hiring 250,000 of them. We're at 7 -- 179,000 now, and 24,000 of them have been promoted already. So that program's in good shape.\"]\n",
    "doug_4 = [\"We're starting to really scale the academies.And as it relates to disaster relief, the company, with all the things that have been going on recently, has contributed $35 million. The customers stepped up, too, and they contributed more than $35 million, so we're over $70 million together that we've contributed. It's, again, an example of Walmart people stepping up and make a different -- making a difference. And the stories I've heard over the last few weeks of what our people have done in Puerto Rico, in Florida and Texas are just amazing stories, and it kind of reminds me of the fact that our people have made the difference in this company. And even in a world that's increasingly influenced by technology, I think that's what our future looks like. We -- we're still people led. We're just even more tech empowered. So it'll be our people that'll lead us into the future.So the key takeaways I wanted to share with you are that we have a plan, and it really does rely on the unique assets and strengths that we have. We got some momentum. I'm proud of the fact that we're starting to move faster. I think we probably need to keep going as it relates to getting faster. And we'll be disciplined with costs and capital as we go.We look forward sharing some our information with you as we go through the morning. Thank you.\"]"
